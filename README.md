# HackX Buildathon - Backend Starter Kit

## Overview
This document outlines the backend design for the **HackX Buildathon Platform**, a fully open-source solution for hosting hackathons where all critical data lives on **IPFS**. This starter kit enables developers to quickly build and deploy a platform that serves the needs of both hackathon organizers and participants. The backend is built using **FastAPI** following a clean, scalable architecture.

## Key Features
- 🚀 **Full Hackathon Lifecycle Management:** From creation and discovery to judging and closing.
- 📦 **Core IPFS Integration:** For project submissions, code, demos, and metadata, ensuring permanence.
- 👤 **User Authentication & Profiles (JWT):** Secure access for participants and organizers.
- 🤝 **Team Formation & Management:** Enables participants to form and manage teams.
- 🏆 **Project Submission & Showcase:** A structured workflow for submitting and displaying projects.
- 🗳️ **Community & Judge Interaction:** Commenting and voting systems for engagement.
- 🧱 **Clean Architecture:** Scalable and easy to understand (endpoint → service → repository).

## Architecture Flow: Project Submission
This diagram shows the sequence of events when a participant submits their project.

    participant Frontend
    participant Backend API
    participant IPFS Service
    participant Database

    Frontend->>Backend API: POST /api/v1/projects (with project data & files)
    Backend API->>IPFS Service: Upload project files (e.g., demo video, source code)
    IPFS Service-->>Backend API: Return IPFS CIDs for the files
    Backend API->>Database: Create project record with text data and IPFS CIDs
    Database-->>Backend API: Confirm record saved
    Backend API-->>Frontend: 201 Created (with new project ID and details)
```

## State Transitions: Hackathon Lifecycle
This diagram illustrates the different states a hackathon can be in.

```mermaid

    [*] --> Upcoming: Organizer creates the event
    Upcoming --> Active: Hackathon start date is reached
    Active --> Judging: Submission deadline passes
    Judging --> Completed: Winners are announced
    Completed --> Archived: Event is in the past
